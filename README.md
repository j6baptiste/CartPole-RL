# CartPole-RL

Welcome in the CartPole-RL directory.

Here you can find python Reinforcement Learning (RL) programs building agents to play cart pole in OpenAI's `gym` environment, using classical RL algorithms.

At the moment are implemented:

 - Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
 - SARSA as presented by Sutton and Barto in "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction"

SARSA(lambda) should be coming next.
